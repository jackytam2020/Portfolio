                          <p>JAYU was my final project in my program at BCIT that I worked on with three other groupmates. This project took around 3 months to complete from September 2019 to end of November 2019</p>
                          <p>JAYU is an app developed for students aiming to improve productivity. More importantly, it hopes to engage students to work collaboratively as a group. The app has four main sections. A calendar that tracks all deadlines, a homework section that allows students to add todo lists of assignments and subsequent task that needs to be checked off to complete each assignment, a classboard section that allows students to post questions and comments, and a marks page calculate grades for each course. </p>
                          <h5>Development Methods</h5>
                          <p>JAYU was developed using React Native and Postgres SQL.</p>

                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Learning Outcomes</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The point of this project was to learn how to work effectively in a collaborative environment. This project taught me how to develop using React Native and proper project management skills. Throughout the development of the app I learned how to use UseEffect to execute functions in various situations such as page load or variable changes. I also used hooks such as UseState to change variables and the user interface. We created our own database and wrote the conditions to CRUD items in each table as well as connect the tables from the database to the front end. Lastly, I learned how to import and use external npm packages that were needed to complete the app. This helped me create many module components that were used in various parts of the app. </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Problems Faced</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">A big problem I faced was that our instructor required us to create functional components instead of class based components as the React Native component is heading towards a similar direction. As a result, looking up for online resources was difficult when I first started developing this app since our program just started learning React Native. With every resource I found online, I had to convert them from class based to functional based in order for recourses to be properly implemented to our app. In addition, our group had a lot of problems displaying the right information from the database. </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Solution to Problems</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">I eventually figured out how to convert class based components by learning how class based functions were written in the first place. I learned that functional components do exactly the same thing except with fewer code and executes tasks more efficiently. Next, most of our problems with our database displaying incorrect information was because they were not being read at the right times. We had no problems creating, updating, or deleting items from our database. We solved our problems by using UseEffect when we need to execute our read functions on page loads or variable changes, and assign read functions to the right buttons that change the UI  </p>

                          <p>This a small project that I worked on over the holidays in December 2019. This is a weather app that displays weather information of every city in the world. Additionally, it will have an animated icon to represent the current weather situation of the selected city. The app pulls two APIs which is google places for the dropdown of all the cities in the world, and the DarkSky weather API. </p>

                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Due to not learning about API calls and not adding APIs to my school final project, I wanted to learn how to make API calls using javascript as I knew that I have to know this as a junior web developer. I built this app by referring to a tutorial. It taught me step by step how to properly make an API call and how to hide API keys as some APIs require payment after a certain amount of calls</p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Problems Faced</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">I had some minor problems of creating my node server as well as connecting the API properly to my script </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Solution to Problems</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">A solved my server problems by just making sure all my syntax were correct. I had a some syntax error that caused the server to crash. I also had to reread the documentation of the DarkSky API and the google API to understand why my APIs were not connected properly</p>

                          <p>Nominations is an app that showcases movies that have won awards from 2010-2018. I made this app with another student who helped with the designs and mockups for our semester end project from February 2019 - April 2019 </p>
                          <h5>Development Methods</h5>
                          <p>Nominations was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>

                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Learning Outcomes</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">As a student focusing primarily on development, I wrote the code that made the app flow from one page to another while displaying correct information. Since we hadn't learned about the back end yet at this point of our program, I learned how to properly manage JSON objects to populate the front end html elements. This project helped me solidify my knowledge on scripting such has making functions, passing values into functions as parameters, using if else conditions, calling functions, proper styling, UI changes from Javascript, and manipulating arrays and objects. </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Problems Faced</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Knowing how to manipulate objects and array was the most problematic issue I had when trying to make this app work. The objects needed to be manipulated as the user clicks through each page since it contains filters that constrict that search result. The right movies had to be displayed when the users choose the range date and award categories. In addition, the app had very large JSON objects so it made it confusing at times to manage. </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Solution to Problems</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> I made some extra functions that helped me display the right movies. Filter was a powerful javascript function that made a new array from me according to the conditions that I assign it as such as year won and categories selected. Movies that did not meet these conditions were not included in the new array. I also wrote another function that pushed and popped items where if the users want to return back to the original screen for new conditions, I had to return the array into its original state that included all the movies. Made sure to also comment wherever i could to help ease with the confusion since the app had very big objects. </p>

                          <p>A small assignment I completed for our Web Development class. This assignment allows users to make posts, delete posts, and like or unlike votes. The front end of the app and the script.js that included ajax functions to populate posts were already provided by our instructor for this assignment. I had to write the php code to handle POST and GET requests. In addition, I wrote the sql queries to select the proper data from the database </p>

                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Understood how to handle GET and POST requests while writing php functions. In addition, I also learned how to properly set up and use a database. Added SQL queries within my php code to pull data from the MySQL database when a POST or GET request was made.  </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Problems Faced</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Since the app had multiple php files, I was confused at first as to where I need to take or pass values from. As a result, there were many occasions where I got errors in the console that said variables were undefined.   </p>
                    <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Solution to Problems</h5>
                    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Once I get a better understanding of the sequence of how I should be handling the data, it became clearer to me which php files I should be working on. Each ajax request should link to the right php file that executes a certain task. I then needed to check if it's a GET or POST request in the specified php file. Each php file is connected to another data.php file which contains all the SQL queries that I should be adding. </p>

                  <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Learning Outcomes</h5>
                  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">I learned how to use the framework library of Materialize Css. Since I never learned how to use a framework css library in my program, I felt that I was necessary that I learned this on my own. This made styling extremely fast compared to only using bare css. I felt that this was a necessary skill in any junior web developer position. </p>
                  <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Problems Faced</h5>
                  <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> Working with the positioning of elements was an issue as well as knowing where to add my own custom css </p>
                  <h5 style="padding-left: 20px;">Solution to Problems</h5>
                  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Simply reading the documentation of Materialize Css helped me understand exactly how the framework works. Some items from the library needs to be initialized first in order for it to work.  </p>
